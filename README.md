# Lottery

## DApp

Lottery is a [Decentralized Application](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/)
(or DApp, for short) build on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/)
using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework for the interface.

## Interact with the Ethereum blockchain

To actually interact with the application, and participate in the lottery, you
will need the [Metamask](https://metamask.io) extension on your browser.

Please connect to the Ropsten test network.

You need some ether to play the lottery. There are [several]() [faucets]() you
can use to get some for free.

## Participate

To participate, nothing is simpler: just set your bet and click `Place bet`.  
A Metamask prompt will pop-up: select a gaz price (3 will do, for exemple)
and confirm the transaction: you will be added to the potential lottery
winners.

The more you bet, the better the chances you have to win the pot.  
For example, if you bet 10 ether you have twice as much chance of
winning compared to someone who placed a bet of 5 ether.

You can place multiple bets, your total balance will be updated.
